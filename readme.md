# Gsuite For Education Services 

G Suite for Education is a suite of free Google tools and services that are tailored for instructors and students. It is different from the usual Google services in that G Suite for Education does not collect students and instructors' data for advertising purposes. There is no indexing of files stored on G Suite and it is in compliance with all data protection and privacy laws. There are many different premium services in the package and we will highlight and continuously update some potential use for the Hertie School here.

### Office Hour Appointment Slots

You can set up an easy and automated office hour appointment system with Google Calendar. To use, please go to https://calendar.google.com/ and sign into the account with your Hertie credentials. 

## Instructor's View

You can create a time block for your office hour as seen below, and specifying the duration of each appointment slots. To make it a repeated time block, please click on More Options.

On the More Options page, you can choose to repeat the time block according to your need.

After saving the time block, there will be a link named This calendar's appointment page. You can share this link with your students or on your course' Moodle page so students can sign up for an office hour appointment.

After they have saved the slot, it will disappear from the available office hour slots. If they cancel, the slot will be available again for others. A Google Meet link will be automatically created and shared with both the students and you.

After the students have signed up for the slots, if you check your calendar, you can see the sign-up.
